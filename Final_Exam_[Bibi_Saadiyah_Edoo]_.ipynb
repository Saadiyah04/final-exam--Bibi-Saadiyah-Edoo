I started with preparing each part of the program as a module, thanks to Week 4’s tip about function reusability, so it was clean and straightforward in its design. With further refinement, I used Week 6’s recommendations by adding error checking and validating inputs to avoid crashes when my code runs. I finished the program by using doctests to check each function, just as in Week 9 and by checking for and handling invalid inputs at every step, like in Week 8. Because I used “Planning Before Coding” and “Iterative Design” as taught in the course, adding new functions was smooth and made the final code more robust and simplified for new programmers.\n",

        "Course Reference: This implementation follows Week 8 lecture content on basic exception handling and Week 9 doctest conventions. It avoids all advanced exception techniques and uses try/except, print() for error reporting, and if statements for input validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.3 Comparison Analysis (4 marks)\n",
        "Consider how this text compares to similar works written in the same time period (4 marks).\n",
        "Similarities:\n",
        "Try/Except Structure – Both versions handle possible runtime issues such as problems connecting or api responses, with try/except blocks. It’s in line with the Week 8 emphasis on handling and dealing with errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "All versions send back a dictionary with details about the weather (temperature, wind speed, summary) when data is available, for a simple and reliable result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Differences:\n",
        "In the ideal version, an additional print statement is included for a missing input, but the improved version makes sure all inputs are there and handles the exception one way without many subtypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ideal case, separate internal and external exceptions with nested try/except blocks, but for the refined version merge them to make it simpler.\n",
        "\n",
        "Course Connection:\n",
        "This assignment illustrates the main ideas from Week 8 such as being ready for errors in external API calls and user input and writing good structured try/except to manage them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improvement Area:\n",
        "A possible improvement after studying Textbook Chapter 6 is to add specific exception types (like requests.exceptions.RequestException) rather than writing except: all the time. Yet, it is not possible to use this feature ready for Week 8. By allowing specific mistakes, debugging becomes more straightforward and less things will be caught as errors as your skills improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Section 4\n",
        "My productivity improved during the last project due to following the “Planning Before Coding” method from the first session and preparing logic in pseudocode first. This way, I drew up what functions were expected and planned user interactions by hand and then let AI assist me in finalizing and testing the actual coding. Widespread use of AI in Weeks 4–6 made it easier to write functions based on the original idea, letting me focus on structure, rules and how to document things.\n",
        "\n",
        "One situation that I clearly used the content from Week 8 was in Section 3, when I put basic try/exceptions to manage problems with APIs and data. Also, I added defensive programming to get_user_choice() in Week 6 by looping until the function received the correct input. Because of these practices, I could interact with the code to spot and prevent runtime errors during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Week 9, I used the “Iterative Design” approach which means I have created a basic working model first and then continue to improve it with more details. I  used Assignment 2 comments to put error checks in place before any API or file operation to maintain proper system behavior under different situations, as explained in the course requirements.\n"
