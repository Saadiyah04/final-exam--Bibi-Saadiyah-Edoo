 **Project Overview**

This project covers:  
A menu-driven \*\*Task Manager\*\* CLI app using lists, functions, and loops  
A \*\*WeatherWise\*\* API tool fetching real-time data with error handling  
Full AI prompting logs and iterative refinements following weekly techniques  
Proper \*\*error correction\*\*, \*\*input validation\*\*, and \*\*doctest examples\*\*

 Skills Demonstrated

Week 3–6\*\*: Control flow, functions, loops, lists, dictionaries  
Week 7–8\*\*: Defensive programming, JSON, API fetches, try/except  
Week 9\*\*: doctest usage, testable code with user input skipping  
Week 10\*\*: Structured design and planning with real-world scenarios

Key Features

Menu system using \`while\` and \`if\` blocks  
Validated user input (numerical \+ empty checks)  
API interaction with wttr.in using \`requests.get()\`  
Graceful error messages via simple exception handling  
Clearly documented with docstrings and inline comments

How to Run

1\. Open the \`Final\_Exam.ipynb\` file in \*\*Google Colab\*\*  
2\. Run each section cell-by-cell  
3\. Use \`doctest\` in the final code blocks:  
   \`\`\`python  
   if \_\_name\_\_ \== "\_\_main\_\_":  
       import doctest  
       doctest.testmod(verbose=True)

**Reflection Summary**  
I have learned Python logic, input check, API services and repeated development with AI assistance during this project. I chose to start by making a plan and I used key ideas from the unit like error checking and using doctests.
